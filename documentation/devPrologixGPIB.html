    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Prologix GPIB-Ethernet Controller is a low cost (and low
      performance) alternative to devices such as the Agilent E5810A.
      This driver provides basic ASYN read/write operations. Serial
      polls, parallel polls and SRQs are not supported.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The most up-to-date versions of the controller manual and
      firmware at the time this module was released are included in the
      documentation directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit the Prologix web site
      at <a href="http://prologix.biz/">http://prologix.biz/</a> to
      check if more recent versions are available.<br>
</p>
<p>If the controller is configured to use DHCP to obtain a network 
address its host name will likely be its ethernet address, with no 
leading zeros and with dashes separating the individual bytes.&nbsp; For
 example, a controller with ethernet address 00:21:69:01:02:E1 will be 
given host name 0-21-69-1-2-e1.&lt;<i>domain</i>&gt;.<br>
    </p>

    <h1>Using the Prologix GPIB driver in an application</h1>
    <p>Several files need minor modifications to use the Prologix GPIB
      driver in an application.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the full path to the PrologixGPIB directory to the
        application <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file:<br>
        <tt>PrologixGPIB=</tt><em>xxxx</em><tt>/modules/bus/PrologixGPIB/&lt;release&gt;</tt><br>
        Where <tt>&lt;release&gt;</tt> is the release number of of the
        Prologix GPIB driver.</li>
      <li>Add instrument support to application database definition file<br>
        The application database definition file must include the
        database definition files for the Prologix GPIB driver and for
        other support modules such as stream device. There are two ways
        that this can be done:
        <ul>
          <li>If you are building your application database definition
            file from an <em>xxx</em><tt>Include.dbd</tt> file you
            include the additional database definitions in that file:<br>
            <tt>include "base.dbd"</tt><br>
            <tt>include "drvPrologixGPIB.dbd"<br>
            </tt> <tt>include "stream.dbd"</tt><br>
          </li>
          <li>If you are building your application database definition
            file from the application Makefile you specify the aditional
            database definitions there:<br>
            <em>xxx</em><tt>_DBD += base.dbd</tt><br>
            <em>xxx</em><tt>_DBD += drvPrologixGPIB.dbd</tt><em></em><br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add the Prologix GPIB support library to the application<br>
        You must link the Prologix GPIB support library and the ASYN
        support library with the application. Add the following lines: <br>
        <em>xxx</em><tt>_LIBS += drvPrologixGPIB</tt><br>
        <em>xxx</em><tt>_LIBS += stream asyn</tt><br>
        before the <br>
        <em>xxx</em><tt>_LIBS += $(EPICS_BASE_IOC_LIBS)</tt><br>
        &nbsp; to the application Makefile.</li>
      
<li>Configure the Prologix GPIB driver in the application startup
        script:<br>
        <tt>prologixGPIBConfigure("L0", "192.168.3.10:1234")<br>
  </tt>The prologixGPIBConfigure command takes four arguments:<tt><br>
  </tt><tt>prologixGPIBConfigure &lt;asynPortName&gt; &lt;host:port&gt; &lt;priority&gt; &lt;flags&gt;<br>
  </tt>TCP port 1234 is used if the ":port" in the &lt;host:port&gt; 
argument is missing. The &lt;priority&gt; argument sets the priority of 
the ASYN worker thread.&nbsp; A zero or missing value sets the priority 
to its default value of epicsThreadPriorityMedium.&nbsp;&nbsp; A missing
 &lt;flags&gt; argument is taken to be 0.&nbsp; The least significant 
bit of the &lt;flags&gt; argument disables auto-connection of the ASYN 
port.&nbsp; The next-to-least significant bit enables diagnostic 
messages on the underlying ASYN port created to communicate with the 
controller.&nbsp; This is useful when diagnosing issues with the initial
 configuration and setup commands sent to the controller.&nbsp; The ASYN
 port name of the underlying ASYN port is the &lt;asynPortName&gt; 
argument with the four characters "_TCP" appended.<br>
<br>
      </li>

    </ol>
    <h1>Installation and Building</h1>
    After obtaining a copy of the distribution, it must be installed and
    built for use at your site.
    <ol>
      <li>Create an installation directory for the module. The path name
        of this directory should end with <tt>modules/bus/prologixgpib</tt>.</li>
      <li>Place the distribution file into this directory.</li>
      <li>Execute the following commands:<br>
        <tt>cd modules/instrument/prologixgpib</tt><br>
        <tt>gunzip prologixgpib&lt;release&gt;.tar.gz</tt><br>
        <tt>tar xvf prologixgpib&lt;release&gt;.tar</tt><br>
        <tt>cd &lt;release&gt;</tt><br>
        Where <tt>&lt;release&gt;</tt> is the release number of of the
        Prologix GPIB driver. </li>
      <li>Edit the <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file and set the paths to
        your installation of EPICS base and ASYN.</li>
      <li>Execute <tt>make</tt> in the top level directory.</li>
    </ol>
